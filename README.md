# MilkFirst Project

Welcome to the MilkFirst project — a modular, microservices-based platform designed for milk delivery and related services.

## Overview

- **Frontend:** ReactJS app handling user interactions and UI.
- **Backend (Java):** Core business logic and main backend API built with Spring Boot.
- **Microservices (Python):** Independent services handling specific functionalities like:
  - Analytics & Reporting
  - Notifications & Emails
  - Recommendations (ML-based)
  - Authentication & Authorization
  - Payment Processing
  - Search & Indexing
  - Image/Video Processing
  - Real-time Chat & Messaging

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo.
2. Navigate to each microservice folder to install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run services independently using Docker or native Python environments.
4. Use the frontend to interact with backend and microservices via their REST APIs.
